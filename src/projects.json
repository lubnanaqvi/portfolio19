With my background in Computer Engineering, I am drawn to various areas of web development from modern JavaScript and functional programming to keeping an eye out for the latest UI/UX trends. Since completing my web development certificate in 2017, I have participated on various group projects and highly value effective and organized collaborative work.  When I am not coding, I enjoy cooking, trying out life hacks and throwing themed parties."
