With my background in Computer Engineering, I am drawn to various areas of web development from modern JavaScript and functional programming to keeping an eye out for the latest UI/UX trends. Since completing my web development certificate in 2017, I have participated on various group projects and highly value effective and organized collaborative work.  When I am not coding, I enjoy cooking, trying out life hacks and throwing themed parties."

It was fun migrating it from plain HTML/CSS to React / Styled Components. It is easy to add / remove and change positions of projects in the grid because of the inherent efficiency of React. This project uses SVGIcons and AnimatedSquares components that I later published on npm as plugins.",
